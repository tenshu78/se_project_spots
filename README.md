In this project, I (the student) had to write code to develope a functioning webpage for an undisclosed coffeeshop. Throughout this webpage, links needed to take the user to the corresponding tab on the page and have little ambiance touch with smoothing transition. With the addition of new skills, linking videoes using embedding codes and other skills like keyframes paired with animation style made a comfortable webpage.

During the first project, one of the comments i recieved was to do more research into mdn commands and seeing more language (for me) keeps this process more engaging. I understand that we are learning the basic but I would have never learned that I could change an img tag to a figure tag for different html commands if it weren't for the feed back. All in all, little bit more vocabulary
